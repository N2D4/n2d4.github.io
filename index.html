                    <i>Jass</i> is a card game in the B√©zique family, originally played in the Netherlands but since it has quickly gained popularity throughout the entirety of Switzerland. Today, Jass is considered Switzerland's national card game, so understandably people (including us) have been wanting a digital version. However, unfortunately, most of these either run on Adobe Flash or are hidden behind a paywall or tons of ads, so we figured it would be our best bet to start work on our own engine. Furthermore, this allows us to implement variants of the game that are popular in particular parts of Switzerland that many other apps don't support.

                    card-game is written in TypeScript and uses modern JavaScript code, with an emphasis on extendibility. As such, it is not particularly hard to implement new variants of Jass, or even adapt it to an entirely different type of card games.

                    Discrete Mathematics is often considered one of the most challenging subjects in the first year of the Computer Science BSc at ETH Zurich. I had the chance to be a teaching assistant during the autumn semester of 2018, leading a group of 25 Discrete Maths students through their first semester. multiple-choices is a tool that uses gamification and a simple and intuitive interface to motivate students to test their knowledge on multiple choice exercises. It turned out the tool spread a tad bit, so people outside my exercise class got the chance to use it, too! :D

                    In 1996, Deep Blue was the first chess computer to defeat the then world champion, Garry Kasparov. In 2019, Bobby Trawler was the first chess computer to defeat me, Stan Wohlwend. Granted, that is not quite true given I've already lost to a good bunch of chess computers before that and it also doesn't say much given I'm a terrible chess player, but it makes for a good introductory line.
                </p>
                <p class="textblock">
                    Bobby Trawler consists of two engines, named Tanner and Daedrian. Tanner is a brute-force engine that simply runs a search on all possible chess moves, using various techniques such as memoization to speed up the process. Daedrian uses a min-max algorithm, allowing it to have more elaborate game plans, but that also means it is less consistent. Because my chess knowledge is limited, the board valuation method is very basic, and also neither of the two engines use an opening book, making Bobby Trawler very vulnerable in the early game. However, if you can not get a decent lead against the computer early on, it becomes hard to defeat in the later stages of the game.

                <p class="textblock">
                    A large number of optimizations have been made on the instruction-level to improve performance. As such, I used benchmarking tools to find out which parts of the program we can improve by inlining critical functions and making the program less vulnerable to low-level problems like cache misses.

                    When participating in competitive programming contests, you often end up using the same algorithms over and over again. For this purpose, I've started putting them into a library where I can re-use them whenever. Being competitive by heart, this library now contains thousands of lines of code and many algorithms and data structures, such as sparse matrices, segment trees, range lists, primitive collections, multimaps, graphs, coloring, cycle detection, flow algorithms, tree traversal, prime factorization, modular arithmetic, string utilities, histograms, fast I/O, genetic optimization, and many more. Note that I can't just use third-party libraries as these are forbidden in most contests.
                </p>
                <p class="textblock">
                    The number one goal is to learn more about the algorithms I'm implementing, which is why I'm always trying to find common ancestors of algorithms and data structures. For example, an adjacency list graph is equivalent to an adjacency matrix graph using a row-list sparse matrix, and Prim's algorithm is really just a special case of A* with a certain heuristics function. This kind of code re-use means that any performance improvement or heuristic I implement on the A* algorithm will subsequently also speed up Prim's.
                </p>
                <p class="textblock">
                    It turns out that most competitive programmers use C++, and the exercises sometimes even expect you to. Java usually is slower, and the fact that I'm using an abstraction above everything does not help. Even though you'd expect constants to not matter in these contests, it turns out they do, and especially in Java where boxing and unboxing primitives is the default when working with generic types cache misses will generally do a huge difference. The library uses several tricks (eg. primitive collections) and heuristics (eg. using a linear search list instead of a hash map for small maps) to combat this.
                </p>
                <p class="textblock">
                    Additionally, it does some other jobs that can be useful during a contest; it has a built-in (disk) caching feature for large pre-processed data, reads input and output files, off-loads work onto multiple threads, bundles and compresses multiple source code files into one big file, and eliminates unneeded classes.

                    I've been coding for a long time. Both my high school term papers were about artificial intelligence, one in philosophy and one in computer science. The latter is about helping Rachel, an artificial intelligence running on my computer, learn to play a simple card game so that she can finally take over the world.
                </p>
                <p class="textblock">
                    To achieve her goal, Rachel uses Q-learning to understand the concept of a game state. For this purpose, I've created a visualization tool in Processing (using Java) which helps understanding the concept of Q-learning. You can try this tool online using the link above.

                    Furthermore, I've implemented a simple feed-forward neural network in Java which can be used in conjunction with the Q-Learner, in a very similar fashion to what Google's DeepMind is doing with AlphaGo. It features several different activation functions and error propagation mechanisms. Combining the two allows Rachel to learn this very simple card game. For more information, refer to the paper.

                    During high school, gaming after school has bonded our class together. One of the video games we played is known under the name <i>Minecraft</i>, famous for many things; amongst them the countless modding and minigame communities. In a group of friends, we had been building a Minecraft minigame server - for this, Jannik and I have coded the required mods in Java.
                </p>
                <p class="textblock">
                    The server is mainly built from two mods. The first is SBAPI, a minigame API. Minecraft is a sandbox game and not a minigame toolkit, and as such creating minigame mods is a hassle. To make this a little easier, we built an entire abstraction layer on top of Minecraft, allowing you to build customizable minigames using only our API in a few lines of code, while leaving all the world generation, match-making, glitch prevention etc. to the API.
                </p>
                <p class="textblock">
                    The other mod is SBServer. It contains the actual game logic and concepts of our server. Minigames include KitPvP (players choose one of many kits each unique with abilities, then fight in an arena), Bedwars (players defend their own bed whilst trying to destroy other players' beds), One in the Quiver (everyone gets a bow, every hit is a kill), Lobby Hockey (ice hockey, but in Minecraft), and many more. Most of them have already existed before on other servers, but our games have always had unique twists.
                </p>
                <p class="textblock">
                    The programming was done by Jannik and me, whereas various other friends worked with us on level building and game design/balance. We've also had several game testing sessions with a broader circle of friends to make sure our games are fair. SBServer had been a pet project for all of us for a very long time; in fact, I don't think there's any other project I've contributed as much code to as this one.
