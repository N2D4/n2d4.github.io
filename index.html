                    <i>Jass</i> is a card game in the B√©zique family, originally played in the Netherlands but since
                    then it has quickly gained popularity throughout the entirety
                    of Switzerland. Today, Jass is considered Switzerland's national card game, so understandably demand
                    for a digital version is huge. However, unfortunately we
                    were very unsatisfied with the choices we had as many online-Jass portals run on Adobe Flash, while
                    others are hidden behind a paywall or tons of ads, so we
                    figured it would be our best bet to start work on our own engine. This way, we can also implement
                    variants of the game that are popular in only small parts of
                    Switzerland that many other apps don't support.

                <p class="textblock">
                    card-game is written in TypeScript and uses a modern, ES6-based coding style. One of our design
                    goals was to make it easily adaptable to new game modes, meaning
                    with just a few lines of code you can implement entirely new variants of Jass. In fact, because
                    everything is modular, it could be easily transformed into an
                    engine for any other card game.

                    Discrete Mathematics is often considered one of the most challenging subjects in the first year of
                    the Computer Science
                    Bachelor at ETH Zurich. I had the chance to be a teaching assistant during the autumn semester of
                    2018, leading a group
                    of 25 Discrete Maths students through their first semester. multiple-choices is a tool that uses
                    gamification and a
                    simple and intuitive interface to motivate students to test their knowledge using multiple choice
                    exercises. It turned
                    out the tool spread a tad bit, so people outside my exercise class got the chance to use it, too! :D

                    I don't think MIPS needs an introduction ‚Äî 40 years old and some people still use it in production!
                    (For better or worse.) It's interesting because it survived the test of time, and also because it's
                    one of the (if not the one) most idiomatic reduced ISAs out there.

                    Containing only a small set of instructions, MIPS is much simpler to implement than CISCs like x86.
                    So, Moritz and I decided to work on a MIPS editor, assembler and emulator for the browser. We spent
                    a lot of time planning the software infrastructure so implementing our interface for a different
                    architecture would be no harder than translating the specification document to source code. This
                    resulted in a modular design where adding, removing and modifying opcodes is trivial.

                    In 1996, Deep Blue was the first chess computer to defeat the then world champion, Garry Kasparov.
                    In 2019, Bobby Trawler was the first chess computer to defeat
                    me, Stan Wohlwend. Granted, that is not quite true given I've already lost to a good bunch of chess
                    computers before that and it also doesn't say much given I'm
                    a terrible chess player, but it makes for a good introductory line.
                </p>
                <p class="textblock">
                    Bobby Trawler consists of two engines, namely Tanner and Daedrian. Tanner is a brute-force engine
                    that simply runs a search on all possible chess moves, using
                    various techniques such as memoization to speed up the process. Daedrian uses a min-max algorithm,
                    allowing it to have more elaborate game plans, but that also
                    means it is less consistent. Because my chess knowledge is limited, the board valuation method is
                    very basic, and also neither of the two engines use an opening
                    book, making Bobby Trawler very vulnerable in the early game. However, if you can not get a decent
                    lead against the computer early on, it becomes hard to defeat
                    in the later stages of the game.

                    I've made a lot of optimizations on the assembly level to improve performance. By using benchmarking
                    tools and analyzing compiler output, I found out which
                    parts of the program can be improved by inlining critical functions and making the program less
                    vulnerable to low-level issues like cache misses.

                    unexperienced server admins, allowing the player to attack
                    it. A combination of multiple vulnerabilities to first open a reverse shell, then gain root access
                    over the system is needed to open the secret flag file.

                    While we initially started Deep Duel with the goal of making an AI learn to play a simple fighting
                    game, we never ended up doing that and instead just
                    emphasized on the fighting game part. Deep Duel is a fast-paced multiplayer duel game where you try
                    to out-maneuver your opponent by hitting, dashing and
                    shooting them on a two-dimensional plane.

                    Deep Duel is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using React for the UX elements, PixiJS for
                    rendering and lance.gg as a multiplayer engine.

                    When participating in competitive programming contests, you often end up using the same algorithms
                    over and over again. For this purpose, I've started putting
                    them into a library where I can re-use them whenever. Being competitive by heart, this library now
                    contains thousands of lines of code and many algorithms and
                    data structures, such as sparse matrices, segment trees, range lists, primitive collections,
                    multimaps, graphs, coloring, cycle detection, flow algorithms, tree
                    traversal, prime factorization, modular arithmetic, string utilities, histograms, fast I/O, genetic
                    optimization, and many more. Note that I can't just use
                    third-party libraries as these are forbidden in most contests.
                </p>
                <p class="textblock">
                    The number one goal is to learn more about the algorithms I'm implementing, which is why I'm always
                    trying to find common ancestors of algorithms and data
                    structures. For example, an adjacency list graph is equivalent to an adjacency matrix graph using a
                    row-list sparse matrix, and Prim's algorithm is really just
                    a special case of A* with a certain heuristics function. This kind of code re-use means that any
                    performance improvement or heuristic I implement on the A*
                    algorithm will subsequently also speed up Prim's.
                </p>
                <p class="textblock">
                    It turns out that most competitive programmers use C++, and the exercises sometimes even expect you
                    to. Java usually is slower, and the fact that I'm using an
                    abstraction above everything does not help. Even though you'd expect constants to not matter in
                    these contests, it turns out they do, and especially in Java
                    where boxing and unboxing primitives is the default when working with generic types cache misses
                    will generally do a huge difference. The library uses several
                    tricks (eg. primitive collections) and heuristics (eg. using a linear search list instead of a hash
                    map for small maps) to combat this.
                </p>
                <p class="textblock">
                    Additionally, it performs some other jobs that can be useful during a contest; it has a built-in
                    (disk) caching feature for large pre-processed data, reads
                    input and output files, automatically off-loads work onto multiple threads, bundles and compresses
                    multiple source code files into one big file, and eliminates
                    unneeded classes.

                    I've been coding for a long time. Both my high school term papers were about artificial
                    intelligence, one in philosophy and one in computer science. The latter
                    is about helping Rachel, an artificial intelligence running on my computer, learn to play a simple
                    card game so that she can finally take over the world.
                </p>
                <p class="textblock">
                    To achieve her goal, Rachel uses Q-learning to understand the concept of a game state. For this
                    purpose, I've created a visualization tool in Processing (using
                    Java) which helps readers understand the concept of Q-learning. You can try this tool online using
                    the link above.
                </p>
                <p class="textblock">
                    Furthermore, I've implemented a simple feed-forward neural network in Java which can be used in
                    conjunction with the Q-Learner, in a very similar (but heavily
                    simplified!) fashion to what Google's DeepMind is doing with AlphaGo. It features several different
                    activation functions and error propagation mechanisms.
                    Combining the two allows Rachel to learn a very simple card game. For more information, please take
                    a look at the paper! :D

                    Invented by Scott Draves in 1992, Fractal Flames build the basis for programs like Electric Sheep
                    and Apophysis. The algorithm procedurally creates nice-looking
                    pictures from only a single initial seed. This technique is now commonly used in computer graphics
                    to generate flame-like or chaotic structures.

                    During high school, gaming after school has bonded our class together. One of the video games we
                    played is called
                    <i>Minecraft</i>, famous for many things; amongst them the countless modding and minigame
                    communities. In a group of
                    friends, we had been building a Minecraft minigame server ‚Äî for this, Jannik and I have coded the
                    required mods in Java.
                </p>
                <p class="textblock">
                    The architecture is split into two mods. The first is SBAPI, a minigame API. Minecraft is a sandbox
                    game and not a minigame toolkit, and as such creating
                    minigame mods is a hassle. To make this a little easier, we built an entire abstraction layer on top
                    of Minecraft, allowing you to build customizable minigames
                    using only our API in a few lines of code, while leaving all the world generation, match-making,
                    glitch prevention etc. to the API.
                </p>
                <p class="textblock">
                    The other mod is SBServer. It contains the actual game logic and concepts of our server. Minigames
                    include KitPvP (players choose one of many kits each unique
                    with abilities, then fight in an arena), Bedwars (players defend their own bed whilst trying to
                    destroy other players' beds), One in the Quiver (everyone gets a
                    bow, every hit is a kill), Lobby Hockey (ice hockey, but in Minecraft), and many more. Most of these
                    are popular games on many Minecraft servers among the
                    community, but all our games always have unique features and twists which make them somewhat
                    different.

                <p class="textblock">
                    The programming was done by Jannik and me, whereas various other friends worked with us on level
                    building and game design/balance. We've also had several game
                    testing sessions with a broader circle of friends to make sure our games are fair. SBServer had been
                    a pet project for all of us for a very long time; in fact,
                    I don't think there's any other project I've contributed as much code to as this one.
